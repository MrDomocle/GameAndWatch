============

Are you making a platformer?

Mystified how to write basic physics for it?

Why not learn from one of the best platformers of all time, Super Mario Bros 3!

I converted the [SMB3 source code](https://github.com/captainsouthbird/smb3) related to player
movement into more readable JavaScript.

Check out the demo here:

[Play with SMB3 Physics](https://raw.githack.com/velipso/smb3-physics/main/index.html)

And read the JavaScript source:
