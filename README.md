============

Are you making a platformer?

Mystified how to write basic physics for it?

Why not learn from one of the best platformers of all time, Super Mario Bros 3!

I read the [SMB3 source code](https://github.com/captainsouthbird/smb3) and converted the 6502
assembly to more readable JavaScript.

Check out the demo here:

And read the source:
